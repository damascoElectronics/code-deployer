## 1. Purpose

This document describes the methodology for tracking known vulnerabilities in third-party and open-source software assets identified in the Software Bill of Materials (BoM) of the component.

---

## 2. Scope

This process applies to all software assets listed in the BoM and focuses on the integration of vulnerability tracking into the Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC) for both released and in-development versions.

---

## 3. Asset Identification and Format

- A curated list of software assets is generated from the BoM.
- Each asset is represented using the [Common Platform Enumeration (CPE)](https://nvd.nist.gov/products/cpe) format for compatibility with public vulnerability databases such as the [National Vulnerability Database (NVD)](https://nvd.nist.gov).
- Example format: cpe:2.3:a:openssl:openssl:1.1.1k:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

## 4. Version Control and Traceability
The list of CPE-formatted assets is stored in a version-controlled repository.

Updates to asset versions or additions/removals are tracked through commits and changelogs.

Traceability between BoM entries and CPE entries is maintained.

---

## 5. Vulnerability Monitoring Process
Automated tools (e.g., nvdlib, osv-scanner) are scheduled to query vulnerability databases using the CPE list.

Discovered CVEs are logged, reviewed, and prioritized based on CVSS scores and impact on the SW component.

Security advisories and remediation timelines are recorded.

---

## 6. Reporting and Auditing
Regular reports are generated for internal reviews and external compliance (e.g., ESA, ECSS standards).

Reports include:

CPE asset list with versions

Known CVEs and their status

Mitigation or patching actions

## 7. Appendix (Optional)
CPE matching heuristics for non-standard packages?
